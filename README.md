<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## CUB3D

 This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.

Use the `Cub3d.pdf` to get started.
