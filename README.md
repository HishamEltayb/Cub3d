## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you‚Äôll have to find your way.</p>

## Introduction
- <p style="color: red;">The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray ‚Äì think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel.</p>


### üîç Importance of Ray-Casting:

* <p style="color: red;">Understanding the basics of 3D rendering and graphics.
* <p style="color: red;">Learning about the intersection of rays and objects in 3D space.
* <p style="color: red;">Developing problem-solving skills in a graphical context.

### üí°Implemetation:
The system integrates multiple components to ensure a seamless and interactive 3D rendering process:

- **Ray-Casting Algorithm**: Implemented in C, handling the core logic of tracing rays and detecting intersections with objects.

- **3D Rendering**: Utilizing the MiniLibX library for rendering the 3D environment.

#### Rendering Process:

1. **Initialization:**
     Setting up the 3D environment and initializing the ray-casting algorithm.

2. **Ray-Casting:**
     Tracing rays from the eye, one per pixel, and detecting intersections with objects.

3. **Rendering:**
     Rendering the 3D environment based on the intersection points and object properties.
