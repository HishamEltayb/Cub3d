## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you‚Äôll have to find your way.</p>

## Introduction
- <p style="color: red;">The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray ‚Äì think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel.</p>


### üîç Importance of Ray-Casting:

* <p style="color: red;">Understanding the basics of 3D rendering and graphics.</p>‚Ä®
* <p style="color: red;">Learning about the intersection of rays and objects in 3D space.</p>‚Ä®
* <p style="color: red;">Developing problem-solving skills in a graphical context.</p>


### üí° Implemetation:

### System Architecture
The system integrates multiple components to ensure a seamless and interactive 3D rendering process:


- **Ray-Casting Algorithm**: Implemented in C, handling the core logic of tracing rays and detecting intersections with objects.
- **3D Rendering**: Utilizing the MiniLibX library for rendering the 3D environment.
Rendering Process
1. Initialization:
    * Setting up the 3D environment and initializing the ray-casting algorithm.
2. Ray-Casting:
    * Tracing rays from the eye, one per pixel, and detecting intersections with objects.
3. Rendering:
    * Rendering the 3D environment based on the intersection points and object properties.
Security Measures
- **Memory Management**: Ensuring proper memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs or errors.
Testing and Deployment
- **Development Environment**:
    * Using the 42 school's development environment for testing and debugging.
- **Deployment**:
    * Deploying the project on a local machine for demonstration purposes.
User Experience Enhancements
- **Interactive Controls**: Implementing user-friendly controls for navigating the 3D environment.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Ensuring smooth and real-time rendering of the 3D environment.

1. **Registration and Authentication**:
   - Secure registration and verification of voters.
   - Encrypted log-in to protect voter identity and access.

2. **Casting Votes**:
   - Simple and secure interface for casting votes.
   - Each vote is recorded on the blockchain.

3. **Counting and Results**:
   - Votes are automatically tallied on the blockchain.
   - Results are publicly available and verifiable.

### Security Measures

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
- **Blockchain Security**: Utilizes blockchain‚Äôs immutability and consensus protocols to protect against tampering.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Thorough testing and auditing of smart contracts to ensure security and functionality.

### Testing and Deployment

- **Development Environment**:
  - Truffle and Ganache for local blockchain testing and development.
  - Integration with Metamask for secure user interactions.
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Deployed smart contracts to the Solana test network.
  - Hosted frontend and backend on a scalable cloud service.

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Notifications and updates on voting status.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Accessible across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Community and Ecosystem Integration

- **Compatibility with Compass**: Designed for easy integration into the Compass esports ecosystem.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling increasing numbers of votes and participants.
